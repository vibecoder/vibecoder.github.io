<h1>Real Conversation</h1>
<time datetime=2022-01-14T22:26:02+0530 class=post-date>Fri, Jan 14, 2022</time>
<p>We live in a time where more and more conversations can be broadcasted online.</p>
<p>We live in a time where more real time interactions can take place in a conversation.</p>
<p>And yet, what we are seeing is that less of these conversations are becoming less empathetic on social media.</p>
<p>Nobody is willing to see the other side of things especially when there is no reason to do that.</p>
<p>You can easily create your own safe space on social media.</p>
<p>You can choose to follow internet &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; that will go to extreme character acting to suit their audience needs.</p>
<p>Their audience would not give them attention if they deviate from this personality they have created.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have to be related to these personality.</p>
<p>The more empathetic person is bound to get abused.</p>
<p>This is because he will relate to that thing thinking it might be a genuine thing. But for a creator it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;content&rdquo; really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never not content. Anything that is there on the internet is content. Anything that is there on the TV is content.</p>
<p>It is meant to extract the exact emotion that they want out of you.</p>
<p>This article is content. Just a self realization check but it&rsquo;s better to be aware than being unconcious about it.</p>
<p>Truth be told. Some of these things on the internet makes me feel that it must be real. Only to find out that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We take popular creators at their face values. Every word they say gets to be the defined truth.</p>
<p>The powerful people hold power with their words.</p>
<p>Therefore it is more important to have real conversations than to watch/create content.</p>
<p>Being anonymous gives you this flexibility just a little. But it&rsquo;s more also like people tend to hide behind their identities that they create.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about this apart from my observations of the social media. So far, the only thing I want to say is that I would like to stay away from it if only I was not so addicted to it.</p>
<p>An addicts mind knows what is harmful for it.</p>
<p>It has a tough time bearing the cost of giving up the addiction.</p>
<p>Similar thing with the internet. With the relationships that we have formed with the presented personality of a person.</p>
<p>All the good in the world gets associated with these internet/tv people. And I am envious of it. I want to adopt some of it.</p>
<p>I want to be like them.</p>
<p>I am envious of other people&rsquo;s success with this.</p>
<p>Cause my thoughts are not linear. My speech is non linear. I have no propaganda (yet).</p>
<p>Since there is no propaganda.. There will never be an audience for this post.</p>
<p>It is most likely to be ignored.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay. I am doing this for myself. This blog is the log of my journey in life.</p>
<p>I have done some posts in a blog that I used to write where I did have a propganda. It still recieves some views now and then.</p>
<p>TBH , it was the most obscure blog post on the subject and yet it shows up on the front page of google search when someone searches it.</p>
<p>It had a slight propaganda like message for an academic institution.. And that post does well.</p>
<p>I recently heard this from a comedian where he says that comics want attention and for that they want to make you laugh. Models want attention and for that they will lose weight.</p>
<p>What does a blogger need to do to get attention?</p>
<p>I know what the youtuber/streamer can do.. they can create drama. They farm dramas.</p>
<p>Am I feeling holier than though right now?</p>
<p>Am I any better than anyone else? Or is that a low self esteem.</p>
<p>Anyways. Thanks for reaching the end of the post. Have a good day. :)</p>
