The differentiated companies won&rsquo;t enter such a market as they would lose their prime customers there and thus is a winning strategy.</p><ol start=3><li><p>Technology Creators</p></li><li><p>Network Orchestrators</p></li></ol><p>The way these businesses can make more profits is considerably different and require different strategies.</p><p>Asset Builders</p><p>These companies use Capital to produce Capability.</p><p>These companies include Airlines , Hotels , Transport , Real Estate etc.</p><p>What these companies do is basically collect assets in exchange of capital to produce revenue.</p><p>The revenue here is usually calculated in terms of Unit / Volume</p><p>In order to produce more profit asset builders must focus on Capability Utilization ( ie. Asset Utilization )</p><p>Service Providers</p><p>These companies use Human Resources to provide Services</p><p>Example : IT Industry , Freelancers , Musicians , Doctors , Lawyers etc.</p><p>The revenue here is calculated in terms of Unit / Time</p><p>In order to produce more profit service providers must focus on Productivity</p><p>-> Talent Management ( Training etc. )</p><p>-> Automation</p><p>Technology Creators</p><p>These companies use technology as a leverage to sell Intellectual Property.</p><p>The main selling point of these companies is the uniqueness of the product.</p><p>Examples include Books , Courses , Music Albums , Films etc.</p><p>The revenue here is usually calculated in terms of Unit / Features or Unit / Uniqueness or Unit / Product ( Book , Course , Album etc. )</p><p>In order to produce more profit technology creators must focus on increasing the value of their product.</p><p>Network Orchestrators</p><p>These companies rely on existing asset builders and consumers.</p><p>They enable the asset builders to reach more asset utilization and also the consumer to reach the producer more easily.</p><p>Thus they act as Marketplace for transactions to take place.</p><p>For Example : Uber , eBay , Ola , AirBNB , Play Store</p><p>The revenue here is calculated in terms of Percentage Fee</p><p>In order to produce more profit these companies must &ldquo;Reduce Friction&rdquo; in the marketplace</p><p>-> Use Ratings for sellers</p><p>-> Targeting</p><p>I hope that you learned something of value from this post.
