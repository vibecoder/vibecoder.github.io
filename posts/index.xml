I feel happy.
I feel that I can do anything this year. Nah. That would be a lie. I have severly lost my life.
The last 7 years have been like this. Nothing has changed.
And I hope this time something changes.
I have only realized this that nothing would change by luck. It has to be done conciously .
I want to change a lot.</description></item><item><title>Karma</title><link>https://blog.vibecoder.dev/posts/karma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 07:01:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vibecoder.dev/posts/karma/</guid><description>I just read the karma yoga chapter of the bhagvad gita and it started to rain.
according to what I thought I read, this rain like my body and my soul, are blessings from him.
So why should one work. cause if god ( if such a thing exist ) stops working then we are all doomed for sure. if it stops to rain, we donâ€™t get any plants, nor any animals will be able to survive.</description></item></channel></rss>
