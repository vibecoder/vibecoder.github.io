I brought this keyboard because I have been looking forward to owning a proper mechanical keyboard again for some time now.
The last proper keyboard I had was the ErgoDox EZ.
It was a good keyboard.

QMK / VIA configuration. This was a bit confusing at first. It still is but I have made some changes to suit my needs.</description></item><item><title>Welcome To My Blog</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/welcome/</guid><description>This is the start of my journey on my way to blog.
I am not a professional blogger in any way right now.
Yes, I have started blogs in the past but right now, I am finally feeling as if I am speaking to the public to express my thoughts.
I think a lot. I think this will be a good outlet for me.
I have setup auto publish using git and hosted this on github.</description></item></channel></rss>
