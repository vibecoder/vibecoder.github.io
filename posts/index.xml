I do not understand what it is trying to resolve.
First thing that I have learned is that ..
The if statements do not need the paranenthesis. Shows up a weird warning. Should not be strict right..
The semicolon is optional . Sometimes it matters othertimes it does not. This is confusing.
println! statement is a macro.</description><content>&lt;p>First of all, rust is totally new to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not understand what it is trying to resolve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thing that I have learned is that ..&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The if statements do not need the paranenthesis. Shows up a weird warning. Should not be strict right..&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The semicolon is optional . Sometimes it matters othertimes it does not. This is confusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>println! statement is a macro.. what does a macro mean..&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>let mut x = 10 ; and const x : i32 = 10 ;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The constant expressions are written as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>const HELLO_WORLD : i32 = 10;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The constant value cannot be evaluated at runtime. Immutable variables can be evaluated during the runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reached till here during my small session.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Decided to skip the guessing_game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not understand match and options and enums yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What the fuck are those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decided to build a fizz buzz.. The loop keyword is like while loop.. But I am not sure how to write a for loop yet.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title/><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/home/</guid><description>Hi there My name is VibeCoder, this place I use to present my ideas.
