The box is made of glass.
So it gives the feeling that everyone should be able to see you.
The body feels tiny. But not that tiny compared to the box.
It&amp;rsquo;s very dark outside. There is no source of light other than a slight ray in the sky.

And yet, what we are seeing is that less of these conversations are becoming less empathetic on social media.
Nobody is willing to see the other side of things especially when there is no reason to do that.
You can easily create your own safe space on social media.</description></item><item><title>Karma</title><link>https://blog.vibecoder.dev/posts/karma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 07:01:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vibecoder.dev/posts/karma/</guid><description>I just read the karma yoga chapter of the bhagvad gita and it started to rain.
according to what I thought I read, this rain like my body and my soul, are blessings from him.
So why should one work. cause if god ( if such a thing exist ) stops working then we are all doomed for sure. if it stops to rain, we donâ€™t get any plants, nor any animals will be able to survive.</description></item></channel></rss>
