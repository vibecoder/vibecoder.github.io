<p>So Today morning , All I had to do was attend class.</p>
<p>This class was taught to us ( Minor in Entrepreneurship ) by Srini Addepalli ( Founder, GlobalGyan )
</p>
<p>I really enjoyed his teachings and found them to be very useful.</p>
<p>Here I would like to share some of my notes with you.</p>
<p>Cost Leadership : </p>
<p>The company reduces the cost of the product while selling the product at the average price.</p>
<p>The companies can reduce their cost using</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volume</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows them to gain a competitive edge over other companies.</p>
<p>Example : Indigo Airlines</p>
<p>In order to do this they create two kind of benefits :</p>
<p>Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility ( Rasgulla Happiness Theorem )</p>
<p>Basically it says that the amount of happiness one gets after consuming a product does not improve much after a certain limit.</p>
<p>For Example :</p>
<p>-> If a person is given one rasgulla , he is happy</p>
<p>-> If he is given another rasgulla , he is happier</p>
<p>-> After third , he is full</p>
<p>-> After fourth , his happiness does not change much</p>
<p>-> After fifth, he is not able to eat any more..</p>
<p>Thus same is the case with innovation, after a certain limit the user happiness does not affect much with the increase in quality of a given feature.</p>
<p>Niche ( Cost Leadership and Differentiation )</p>
<p>To enter the market , companies can focus on small niche of users.</p>
<p>Such as a equipment specifically for surgeons. The differentiated companies won&rsquo;t enter such a market as they would lose their prime customers there and thus is a winning strategy.</p>
<ol start=3>
<li>
<p>Technology Creators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network Orchestrators</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The way these businesses can make more profits is considerably different and require different strategies.</p>
<p>Asset Builders</p>
<p>These companies use Capital to produce Capability.</p>
<p>These companies include Airlines , Hotels , Transport , Real Estate etc.</p>
<p>What these companies do is basically collect assets in exchange of capital to produce revenue.</p>
<p>The revenue here is usually calculated in terms of Unit / Volume</p>
<p>In order to produce more profit asset builders must focus on Capability Utilization ( ie. Asset Utilization )</p>
<p>Service Providers</p>
<p>These companies use Human Resources to provide Services</p>
<p>Example : IT Industry , Freelancers , Musicians , Doctors , Lawyers etc.</p>
<p>The revenue here is calculated in terms of Unit / Time</p>
<p>In order to produce more profit service providers must focus on Productivity</p>
<p>-> Talent Management ( Training etc. )</p>
<p>-> Automation</p>
<p>Technology Creators</p>
<p>These companies use technology as a leverage to sell Intellectual Property.</p>
<p>The main selling point of these companies is the uniqueness of the product.</p>
<p>Examples include Books , Courses , Music Albums , Films etc.</p>
<p>The revenue here is usually calculated in terms of Unit / Features or Unit / Uniqueness or Unit / Product ( Book , Course , Album etc. )</p>
<p>In order to produce more profit technology creators must focus on increasing the value of their product.</p>
<p>Network Orchestrators</p>
<p>These companies rely on existing asset builders and consumers.</p>
<p>They enable the asset builders to reach more asset utilization and also the consumer to reach the producer more easily.</p>
<p>Thus they act as Marketplace for transactions to take place.</p>
<p>For Example : Uber , eBay , Ola , AirBNB , Play Store</p>
<p>The revenue here is calculated in terms of Percentage Fee</p>
<p>In order to produce more profit these companies must &ldquo;Reduce Friction&rdquo; in the marketplace</p>
<p>-> Use Ratings for sellers</p>
<p>-> Targeting</p>
<p>I hope that you learned something of value from this post. Please leave a feedback if you like it.</p>
<p>Cheers :)</p>
