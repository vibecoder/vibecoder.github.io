<h1>Stuck in a Box</h1>
<time datetime=2022-01-20T05:53:08+0530 class=post-date>Thu, Jan 20, 2022</time>
<p>There is a box. The box is made of glass.</p>
<p>So it gives the feeling that everyone should be able to see you.</p>
<p>The body feels tiny. But not that tiny compared to the box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dark outside. There is no source of light other than a slight ray in the sky.</p>
<p>Yet there is enough light to figure out if someone is outside.</p>
<p>The box is small. There is no door or windows. No hinges.</p>
<p>Just four plain sheets of glass connected to each other to form a jar.</p>
<p>There is no ground. But there is gravity.</p>
<p>You can make out human like figures in the distance. Walking on sand.</p>
<p>The sand stretches for eternity on what feels like infinite horizon.</p>
<p>You call them out on the top of your lungs.</p>
<p>You scream. You cry for help. You ask them if they can listen to you..</p>
<p>They are able to listen to you. You can see them nodding.</p>
<p>They want to help but they don&rsquo;t know how. They get disturbed a little seeing you.</p>
<p>They see you struggling.</p>
<p>But with the amount of help that they have.. it seems impossible for them to be able to help you.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t make you their problem. And thus they all leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only your problem that you are in the glass box after all.</p>
<p>They can empathize with your problem. But they can&rsquo;t help. No one till now could.</p>
<p>Thus all hope that they had for you is lost.</p>
<p>Time slows down. Cause you have nothing to compare time to other than your own heart beat.</p>
<p>You check to see what you are.. The body seems weird.</p>
<p>Unlike the one that you have ever had.</p>
<p>You feel tired and numb.</p>
<p>You check to see what you are wearing. It&rsquo;s plain clothes all in black. With white shoes.</p>
<p>Your pockets are all empty. There is nothing else in that box other than you.</p>
<p>You scream only to be heard and then be ignored.</p>
<p>To them all they would want now is for you to disappear.</p>
<p>You disappearing would end their own suffering, their own guilt for not being able to help you.</p>
<p>To them, you being alive is a problem.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t help then but want to disappear.</p>
