One day, I suddenly get a call from a recruiter based on my profile from Naukri.com
On the call, the recruiter basically just asked me directly when I would like to have the interview.
I was initially impressed that they decided to move it fast but this feeling did not last long..
Immediately I got an invite for the interview.

And sighed.</p><p>For again, I realised that the interview was gonna suck.</p><p>Thing is &mldr; the first thing that was mentioned on the email was this.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>This interview will require Internet Explorer. 
Please assure that you have a device that runs Windows 10/11.
You won&#39;t be able to give this interview from a Linux/MacOS
</code></pre><p>Ahh&mldr; The pain!!</p><p>The time booked was for 4 hours this Saturday. From 11AM to 3PM..</p><p>Feels like I wasted my whole Saturday for them.</p><p>I got my girlfriends old Surface laptop and hooked it up with my Apple Magic Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse.</p><p>I had no way of connecting it to a monitor..</p><p>Since the charging port was occupied I could not connect my usual keyboard..</p><p>The Apple Magic Keyboard connected to that old surface laptop had very weird funcitonality..</p><p>The @ was mapped to "</p><p>The " was mapped to @</p><p>The # was mapped to Â£</p><p>All of this had to be done at the morning 9AM .</p><p>Given that I had zero time to configure the Windows laptop to my needs, I just said f it and went ahead with the hardware setup.</p><p>But nah.. this was not the only hardware setup that I had to manage!</p><p>I went ahead and opened Microsoft Edge and turned on Internet Explorer compatibility mode.</p><p>I opened their stupid shitty slow website.</p><p>It then installed 4 to 5 software on the laptop requiring admin priviliges each time to do so..</p><p>There was one place in the email where it simply asked me to disable admin priviliges escalation notifications so that I do not get pinged continously.</p><p>Things were definitely getting weirder.</p><p>After about 15 mins of all the installations I was able to spin up the Windows VM Server on Samsung Website from my Windows Device..</p><p>Then the email asked me to install some app on my iPhone . But this installation was not just simple.. It almost had a side loading thing.. It asked me to go to Settings>General>ProfileManagement and then click on &ldquo;Trust Samsung&rdquo;</p><p>God I had already lost trust in Samsung by now..</p><p>Using this I was able to join the meeting.</p><p>After a few minutes, I was met with a very rude proctor..</p><p>They checked my Government ID.. asked me to rotate the camera and show the room..</p><p>Then literally asked me to &ldquo;throw&rdquo; away my macbook!</p><p>My girlfriend was in the room.. The proctor rudely asked me to remove her from the room.</p><p>I was about to abort the interview.. The proctor literally threatened to shut off the interview. I was like .. Damn, I am not scared right now..</p><p>I am just scared that this entire process might have compromised the device and the data on it.</p><p>But somehow I still got to the problem statement. I had to mount my iPhone on a stand so that they could always see me typing.</p><p>And then the test and everything went silent..</p><p>The problem statement was really shitty.</p><hr><h1 id=problem-statement>Problem Statement</h1><p>There is a cylinder it has m columns and n rows. Find the minimal number of rotations so that the stars in each row can be aligned in a column.</p><p>Oh god, I am not able to find this type of problem online.</p><p>I think it involves backtracking ? or DP ?</p><p>I had a brute force solution which worked for the sample problems and for the big problems too..</p><p>Somehow , it still exceeded the runtime allowed in Python.</p><p>I think if I had written the same solution in Cpp I would have got a better outcome.</p><p>Oof even writing about the problem statement seems so traumatic and might trigger PTSD ( dramatic much .. )</p><p>More about it later.</p><p>2 Hours later, I was just done with the whole thing.</p><p>This whole interview made me remind that my current job is not half bad lol!</p><p>Even if they do select me for their next rounds I am sure that I won&rsquo;t be sitting for the next round.</p><hr><p>I think this whole interview process really showed me the current corporate culture in Korea.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s quite toxic.</p><p>I should have not given the interview when I started to notice down the red flags.</p><p>Their first email itself was a major red flag!</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
