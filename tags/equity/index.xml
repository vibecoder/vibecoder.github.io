First of all, I will start that I got to learn many things yesterday about equity.
Investors are important. ( Maybe ) but they are not active in the business.
Hence it makes more sense to pay equity to employees as a startup.
Of-course both investors and employees and all the stakeholders ( shareholders ) must be vested.
Vesting is an important contract.</description><content>&lt;p>Business Lesson : Pay equity to employees more than investor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, I will start that I got to learn many things yesterday about equity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Investors are important. ( Maybe ) but they are not active in the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hence it makes more sense to pay equity to employees as a startup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of-course both investors and employees and all the stakeholders ( shareholders ) must be vested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vesting is an important contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If it is there, then it means that the business partners and stakeholders trust each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s lack means that the individuals are not able to trust each other freely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equity is for those who are actively working in an organization. Note the word &amp;ldquo;Active&amp;rdquo;.. Active investors, active advisors, active founders, active employees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the company stocks get into the hands of those who are idle. Then it acts as a hindrance to decision making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus vesting ensures that equity is on the hands of those who are active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you soon. Peace :) \m/&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
