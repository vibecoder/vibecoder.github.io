But we have to configure it.
Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s just a text editor.
The one down side I found is that it cannot be used very effectively over ssh.
Usually the VM&amp;rsquo;s are not configured like the way nvim is done locally.
So not a good idea to use it?
Nah, still it is so smooth and fast to use it as if this is the only thing that has made editing my files as fast as my thoughts.</description></item><item><title>Keychron K8 Pro</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/keychron-k8-pro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/keychron-k8-pro/</guid><description>Why a new keyboard? I brought this keyboard because I have been looking forward to owning a proper mechanical keyboard again for some time now.
The last proper keyboard I had was the ErgoDox EZ.
It was a good keyboard.
But this is even better I think.
QMK / VIA configuration. This was a bit confusing at first. It still is but I have made some changes to suit my needs.</description></item></channel></rss>
