This is the about page and for me, this page can be considered as one of the most difficult page to write because it involves writing about my objective self.
I wish to become an entrepreneur and start my own profitable and scalable business.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/page/contact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:24:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/page/contact/</guid><description>Please contact me at vibecoderdev@gmail.com

I am not a professional blogger in any way right now.
Yes, I have started blogs in the past but right now, I am finally feeling as if I am speaking to the public to express my thoughts.
I think a lot. I think this will be a good outlet for me.
I have setup auto publish using git and hosted this on github.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vibecoder.dev/todo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/todo/</guid><description>Make the center footer wide..
