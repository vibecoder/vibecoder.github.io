Curretnly working as Senior Member of Technical Staff at Oracle. Working on the Oracle Analytics team.
I studied from B.Tech (2014 - 2018) in Engineering Science and Computer Science from IIT Hyderabad.
This is the about page and for me, this page can be considered as one of the most difficult page to write because it involves writing about my objective self.
I wish to become an entrepreneur and start my own profitable and scalable business.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/page/contact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:24:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/page/contact/</guid><description>Please contact me at vibecoderdev@gmail.com

I have never really prepared for interviews. It has been a long time and I am doing this to keep my chances of being employable and being employed.
First, I am starting off with the cracking the coding interview book.
I have not done enough leetcode problems but that&amp;rsquo;s fine. We will deal with it when it happens.</description></item><item><title>My journey of switching code editors</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/shifting-to-nvim/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/shifting-to-nvim/</guid><description>So sometime back , I decided to switch to the latest hotshot meme that I witnessed.
I was casually browsing Twitch, bored out of my mind looking for something fun.
I for a random reason decided to search for &amp;ldquo;Software&amp;rdquo; and I saw the primeagen streaming..
A goofball coder with Dr Disrespect asthetics. But also works at Netflix and has a solid knowledge of what he is doing with the code.</description></item><item><title>Learning rust</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/rust/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/rust/</guid><description>First of all, rust is totally new to me.
I do not understand what it is trying to resolve.
First thing that I have learned is that ..
The if statements do not need the paranenthesis. Shows up a weird warning. Should not be strict right..
The semicolon is optional . Sometimes it matters othertimes it does not. This is confusing.
println! statement is a macro.. what does a macro mean.</description></item><item><title>Notes on Communication</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/notes-on-communication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 19:26:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/notes-on-communication/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I was watching Ajay Banga&amp;rsquo;s interview and Ayn Rand&amp;rsquo;s interview today (videos embedded at the end of article), I realized something that should be considered very important :&lt;/p>

This post actually was a nice idea and I really felt that something more could be learnt from it.
I would highly recommend you to read the article linked below
[Speed vs Velocity] (https://www.fs.blog/2018/03/speed-velocity/)
I have had my own share of personal experience with this analysis of focus and would like to share it.</description></item><item><title>The Hardest Thing Ever</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/the-hardest-thing-ever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:22:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/the-hardest-thing-ever/</guid><description>The hardest thing ever is to never forget your why.
the harder thing is to not get distracted.
Why are you doing what you doing? And for what , for whom.
This is hard. Other noises of your environment will make you move away from that.
Because they don&amp;rsquo;t care for your why.
There is nothing that they will gain from it.
Cheers :smiley:</description></item><item><title>Doing Things That Matter</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/doing-things-that-matter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 18:14:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/doing-things-that-matter/</guid><description>All of us are given approximately the same time.
Then why do some people tend to deliver better results than others?
Simply because they do things that matter the most to them and ignore the rest.
Not everything in life matters equally.
Not every decision matters equally.
To-do list is often a lie. Some tasks areÂ more important than others.</description></item><item><title>Focus: X divided by infinity is zero</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/focus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 18:10:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/focus/</guid><description>A small and relatively simple concept that I have learned over the last 2 years is this.
Effort or time divided into many different , unrelated areas of focus would result in a very small output where as concentrated efforts would lead to more and more output.
If a person, puts his effort into many unrelated fields, it leads to a constant state of unhappiness and confusion.
If a business sells many different varieties of products, it might find difficulty in selling their products under the same brand.</description></item><item><title>Case Studies with the Biz Doc, Mr. Thomas Ellsworth</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/case-studies-tom-ellsworth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 13:39:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/case-studies-tom-ellsworth/</guid><description>Mr. Thomas Ellsworth is awesome.
I love the content that he produces and I eagerly wait every Friday for him to upload his videos on my favourite YouTube channel Valuetainment.
The lessons that one can get from his case studies are extremely helpful.
The whole of Valuetainment is a gold mine for any entrepreneur and would recommend anyone to watch some of their content even if they are not an entrepreneur.</description></item><item><title>Business Lesson: Employee Equity</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/employee-equity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 10:28:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/employee-equity/</guid><description>Business Lesson : Pay equity to employees more than investor.
First of all, I will start that I got to learn many things yesterday about equity.
Investors are important. ( Maybe ) but they are not active in the business.
Hence it makes more sense to pay equity to employees as a startup.
Of-course both investors and employees and all the stakeholders ( shareholders ) must be vested.
Vesting is an important contract.</description></item><item><title>Cost Leadership, Differentiation and Profit Models</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/cost-leadership-differentiation-profit-models/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 12:50:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/cost-leadership-differentiation-profit-models/</guid><description>So Today morning , All I had to do was attend class.
This class was taught to us ( Minor in Entrepreneurship ) by Srini Addepalli ( Founder, GlobalGyan ) I really enjoyed his teachings and found them to be very useful.
Here I would like to share some of my notes with you.
Cost Leadership : The company reduces the cost of the product while selling the product at the average price.</description></item><item><title>A Business is like a Farm : The Farm Analogy</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/a-business-is-like-a-farm-analogy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 21:39:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/a-business-is-like-a-farm-analogy/</guid><description>A business is just like a farm.
Infact farming is a business that is easy for most people to understand.
You have to take care of it everyday.
You have to do the hustle and reach out to your customers.
You need land for your farm ( Initial Investments )
You hire employees to take care of your farm.
You have to regularly water it.
You have to take out the weeds.</description></item><item><title>The Great Branch of Engineering Science at IITH</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/engineering-science/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2016 20:12:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/engineering-science/</guid><description>Hi, I am Vibhas, studying Engineering Science at IITH ( 2014 batch ). So let me introduce you to our branch.
( I am writing this down here as some of the content on official website has not been updated yet )
No other IIT has it like ours.
Although I am not going to declare it the best branch ever. But it&amp;rsquo;s quite close to that.
B.Tech. in Engineering Science, at IIT Hyderabad, is a unique program offered in India for the first time.</description></item><item><title>HungerTorrent : Food delivery system</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/hungertorrent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 00:39:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/hungertorrent/</guid><description>We delivered food to IITH students and the food was delivered by the students of college itself who went to the city on their own. We then asked them to bring our orders from restaurants and in return they got heavily paid for the delivery.
We setup the website at hungertorrent.xyz ( Cheap Domain :P )
We started the program, a day after we attended AugustFest
Now the static website has been hosted atÂ http://hungertorrent.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vibecoder.dev/todo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/todo/</guid><description>Make the center footer wide..
