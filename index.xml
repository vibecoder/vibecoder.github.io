I was casually browsing Twitch, bored out of my mind looking for something fun.
I for a random reason decided to search for &amp;ldquo;Software&amp;rdquo; and I saw the primeagen streaming..

&lt;p>I for a random reason decided to search for &amp;ldquo;Software&amp;rdquo; and I saw the primeagen streaming..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A goofball coder with Dr Disrespect asthetics. But also works at Netflix and has a solid knowledge of what he is doing with the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he was using terminal to edit the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was not totally new to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard of vi and nano before and have used them in my servers where the GUI were not available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been some time since I have used nano. Haven&amp;rsquo;t used it in the last 6 years to be exact, when I made the move to switch from Ubuntu to Arch Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had not always known how to exit vi but I figured it out soon.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Learning rust</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/rust/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/posts/rust/</guid><description>First of all, rust is totally new to me.
I do not understand what it is trying to resolve.
First thing that I have learned is that ..
The if statements do not need the paranenthesis. Shows up a weird warning. Should not be strict right..
The semicolon is optional . Sometimes it matters othertimes it does not. This is confusing.
println! statement is a macro.</description><content>&lt;p>First of all, rust is totally new to me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First thing that I have learned is that ..&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The if statements do not need the paranenthesis. Shows up a weird warning. Should not be strict right..&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The semicolon is optional . Sometimes it matters othertimes it does not. This is confusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>println! statement is a macro.. what does a macro mean..&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>let mut x = 10 ; and const x : i32 = 10 ;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The constant expressions are written as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>const HELLO_WORLD : i32 = 10;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The constant value cannot be evaluated at runtime. Immutable variables can be evaluated during the runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reached till here during my small session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decided to skip the guessing_game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not understand match and options and enums yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What the fuck are those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decided to build a fizz buzz.. The loop keyword is like while loop.. But I am not sure how to write a for loop yet.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://vibecoder.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vibecoder.dev/about/</guid><description>Hi there My name is VibeCoder, this place I use to present my ideas.
