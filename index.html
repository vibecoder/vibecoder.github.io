growth is a necessity of life.
progression is a necessity of life.
sleep is a neccisity of life.
food and water are a necessity
social interactions are a necessity.
nicotine, caffeine, alcohol are not. video games are not. youtube and social media are not the only sources of social interactions and they are not necessity of life. drugs are not a necessity of life.
Make sure that you know what your necessities are.

I have been struggling to look for hobby.
I think I have finally begin to narrow it down.
First and foremost. Let&rsquo;s establish what are the parameters of a good hobby.
It should be fun.
It should be destressing.
It should not cause pain afterwards.
It should not cause me to lose my mind in it.

There is a box. The box is made of glass.
So it gives the feeling that everyone should be able to see you.
The body feels tiny. But not that tiny compared to the box.
It&rsquo;s very dark outside. There is no source of light other than a slight ray in the sky.
Yet there is enough light to figure out if someone is outside.
The box is small. There is no door or windows.

Hi Guys, I have multiple addictions in life.. there has been weed , porn, games, social media scrolling.. I would say that I am a guy (26yo now) with many addictions. I like to work and have decent source of income but my free time gets consumed by these addictions a lot more than I would like them to be.
But here I wanted to post about my first ever conquer over a addiction.

We live in a time where more and more conversations can be broadcasted online.
We live in a time where more real time interactions can take place in a conversation.
And yet, what we are seeing is that less of these conversations are becoming less empathetic on social media.
Nobody is willing to see the other side of things especially when there is no reason to do that.
You can easily create your own safe space on social media.

I just read the karma yoga chapter of the bhagvad gita and it started to rain.
according to what I thought I read, this rain like my body and my soul, are blessings from him.
So why should one work. cause if god ( if such a thing exist ) stops working then we are all doomed for sure. if it stops to rain, we don’t get any plants, nor any animals will be able to survive.
